# Composer template for Drupal projects

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

## Usage

1. [Install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).
1. Create the project : `composer create-project drupaljedi/project project_name --stability dev --no-interaction`
1. Replace all occurrences of `project_name` with your project name in the following files:
`docroot/sites/default/settings.php`
`docroot/sites/prj-settings.inc`
`provision/local/docker-compose.yml`
`provision/dev/docker-compose.yml`
`provision/stage/docker-compose.yml`
1. Create directory `provision/local/docker-runtime/settings`
1. Copy with your project name the `provision/local/example.project_name-settings.inc` file into the `provision/local/docker-runtime/settings` directory and replace all credentials to the right ones.
1. Run docker containers: `cd provision/local && docker-compose up -d`
1. Install Drupal: `./tools/scripts/install.sh`

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your 
installation.

```
cd project_name
composer require drupal/be_sure
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the 
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit 
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `docroot`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`drupal/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `docroot/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `docroot/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `docroot/profiles/contrib/`

## Updating Drupal Core

This project will attempt to keep all of your Drupal Core files up-to-date; the 
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) 
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is 
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess), 
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modified files are updated in a 
new release of Drupal core.

Follow the steps below to update your core files.

1. Run `composer update` to update Drupal core, contrib modules and its dependencies.
1. Run `git diff` to determine if any of the scaffolding files have changed. 
   Review the files for any changes and restore any customizations to 
  `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `docroot` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.

## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download?

Composer recommends **NO**. They provide [argumentation against but also
workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### Should I commit the scaffolding files?

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, â€¦) to the docroot/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@drupal-scaffold` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "drupal-scaffold": "DrupalComposer\\DrupalScaffold\\Plugin::scaffold",
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull 
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the 
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra 
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
